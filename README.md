#Histopathologic Cancer Detection - CNN Exploration

This repository contains the code and analysis for a class assignment focused on detecting metastatic cancer in histopathologic images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project is based on the [Kaggle Histopathologic Cancer Detection competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection).

#Models Tested

- Shallow CNN
- Deep CNN
- Double Convolution CNN
- Double Deep CNN
- Double Deep CNN + RMSprop Optimizer
- Double Deep CNN + L2 Regularization

#Evaluation Metrics
Models were evaluated based on: Validation Accuracy and Validation Loss
